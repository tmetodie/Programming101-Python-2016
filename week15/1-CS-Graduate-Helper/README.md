# Computer Science Graduate Helper

We are going to use our Django skills in order to help almost every CS grad out there.

We have provided you with [`index.html`](index.html) - a plain HTML & CSS page, that you can open & look in any browser.

Your job is to hook all the forms with Django views & do the calculations required, by showing the result after that.

**Requirements are:**

* Every form needs to be handled by a separate view.
* All views need to answer only to `POST` calls.
* There's no need for you to use Django Forms or Models. Just views & urls.
